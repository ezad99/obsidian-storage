# Notes
The collision of the traditional IT role and DevOps

SRE is a 50/50 role 
	50% Dealing with customer issues, incidents, escalations/customer facing
	50% Should automate everything/reducing coil

Approaching operations with a development mindset

SRE's have knowledge on how a software runs in a practical sense

Constantly feeds data to developers to make it better

Excels at identifying potential failures and solve them early 

And good at solve immediate problems

Monitoring and Logging are key
	Monitoring are used to anticipate failure and have a proactive fix
	Logging when you get an unanticipated failure and go back
		Able to do a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and solve the issue for now and automate the solution for the future
	The monitoring will be adjusted and prevent that failure again

Failure is an option, but can be automated to solve 

Constantly going back and automating solving failures

The less manual work the better the SRE team
