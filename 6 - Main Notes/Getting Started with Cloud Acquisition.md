# Getting Started with Cloud Acquisition
## Cloud Acquisition Fundamentals:

Cloud Computing allows:
- On -demand access to IT resources over the internet
- Pay only for the individual licenses they need
- No required long-term contracts or complex licensing

## Key Aspects of Procurement

Pricing
- CSP pricing should be offered using a pay-as-you-go utility model, where at the end of each month, you pay for your usage
- Allowed flexibility to fluctuate based on the market pricing, so you can take advantage of the dynamic and competitive nature of cloud pricing

Security
- CSPs are responsible for providing services through a highly secure and controlled infrastructure and for providing a wide array of additional security features. 
- The respective responsibilities of you and the CSP depend on the cloud deployment model used -  infrastructure-as-a-service IaaS, software-as-a-service SaaS and platform-as-a-service PaaS

Governance
- Be able to retain full control and ownership over your data 
- Be able to choose the geographic locations in which to store your data
- Provide access to cloud portability tools and services that enable you to move data on and off your cloud infrastructure as needed.
- Have no required minimum commitments or long-term contracts

Term and Conditions
- Cloud computing should be purchased as a commercial item which is:
	- An item that has been sold, leased, licensed or otherwise offered for sale to the general public
	- Generally performs the same for all users or customers, whether commercial or government
