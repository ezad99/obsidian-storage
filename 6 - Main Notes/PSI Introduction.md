**Weekly Reading Notes**
The paper "Reason, Relativity, and Responsibility in Computer Ethics" by James H. Moor explores the complexities of computer ethics in the context of globalization and technological advancement. It argues that as computing becomes ubiquitous, ethical considerations must evolve to address new challenges.

1. **Definition of Computer Ethics**: Moor defines computer ethics as the analysis of the social impact of computer technology and the formulation of policies for its ethical use. He emphasizes the need for thoughtful analysis and justification of ethical policies.
    
2. **Unique Challenges**: The paper highlights that computer ethics is distinct due to the logical malleability of computers, which allows them to be applied in unpredictable ways, creating policy vacuums. This malleability leads to situations that are often informationally enriched, complicating ethical understanding.
    
3. **Critique of Ethical Views**: Moor critiques Routine Ethics for underestimating the changes in conceptual frameworks and Cultural Relativism for overlooking the stability of core human values. He argues that both perspectives fail to adequately address the unique ethical challenges posed by computing.
    
4. **Global Information Ethics**: The paper calls for a new era of global information ethics, where ethical considerations must be broader and more profound to ensure technology serves democratic and empowering purposes.
    
5. **Ongoing Ethical Dialogue**: Moor stresses the importance of continuous dialogue and policy formulation in computer ethics, as new technologies and their consequences emerge. He believes that rational discussion about values is possible, even in the face of cultural differences.
    
6. **Conclusion**: The paper concludes that while the computer revolution presents significant ethical challenges, it also offers opportunities for positive change. By grounding discussions in shared human values, society can navigate the complexities of computer ethics effectively.

**Tutorial Notes**
**1. Difference Between Law and Ethics**

- **Law**: A set of rules enforced by a governing body (like a state or nation) with legal consequences for breaking them.
- **Ethics**: Moral principles that guide individual behavior, often subjective and based on personal, societal, or professional standards.
- **Example of Legal but Unethical (Computing-related)**: Selling user data to third-party advertisers without clear user consent may be legal but unethical.
- **Example of Illegal but Ethical**: Accessing a system without authorization to expose a security flaw (white-hat hacking) may be illegal but ethical.

**2. Official Sources for UK Computer Misuse Act and EU GDPR**

- **UK Computer Misuse Act (1990)**: Protects against unauthorized access to computer systems, hacking, and misuse of data. It's enforced in the UK and is key for cybersecurity.
    - Computer Misuse Act
- **EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Designed to protect personal data and privacy of individuals within the EU. It's essential for data protection and applies to any organization processing EU citizens' data.
    - [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj)

**Importance for Computer Scientists**:

- Ensures responsible handling of data.
- Sets legal boundaries for system access and data privacy.
- Vital for ensuring cybersecurity and compliance in software development.

**3. Difference Between Criminal and Civil Law**

- **Criminal Law**: Involves actions considered harmful to society as a whole, prosecuted by the state, and may result in imprisonment or fines (e.g., theft, fraud).
- **Civil Law**: Concerns disputes between individuals or organizations, often involving compensation rather than punishment (e.g., breach of contract, property disputes).

---

**4. Law of Precedence (Stare Decisis)**

- **Precedence**: Legal principle where courts follow prior rulings (precedents) in similar cases.
- **How It Works**: Higher court decisions bind lower courts; decisions from courts at the same level may influence but not bind.
- **In UK Law**: Ensures consistency in legal decisions across the judiciary. Lower courts must follow higher courts’ rulings unless there’s a compelling reason to deviate.

**5. Hierarchy of Courts in the UK**

1. **Supreme Court**: The highest court, final appeals.
2. **Court of Appeal**: Divided into Civil and Criminal Divisions, handles appeals from lower courts.

4. **Crown Court**: Handles serious criminal cases and appeals from Magistrates' Court.
5. **Magistrates' Court**: Deals with minor criminal cases and some civil matters.
6. **County Court**: Deals with civil disputes (e.g., small claims).

**6. Appeal Court Case (1988)**

- **Summary of Key Points from 1988 Case**:
    - Involved an appeal where the court revisited prior decisions.
    - Established or reinforced a legal precedent.
    - Outcome impacted future similar cases.
