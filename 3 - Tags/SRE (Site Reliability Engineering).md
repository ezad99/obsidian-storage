# SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)
SRE is a discipline that applies software engineering to infrastructure and engineering

SRE is a 50/50 role
	50% is customer facing and dealing with issues
	50% is automated solutions to issues

Site Reliability Engineers have knowledge on how a software runs in a practical setting

They constantly feed data to developers to make the software better

They should excel at identifying potential failures and solve them early

And also solve immediate issues

The 2 main tools of SRE are Monitoring and Logging

Here are the steps:
Monitoring
	1. Anticipate a failure
	2. Have a fix for it
Logging
	1. Find an unanticipated failure
	2. Do RCA (Root Cause Analysis)
	3. Solve the issue for now
	4. Automate the solution for the future monitoring

Failure is an option, but should be automated to solve it 

DevOps vs SRE
	DevOps focuses more on the culture and procedures between development and operations
	SRE focuses on applying engineering principles for better reliability and to automate everything

Ultimately, the less manual work, the better for SRE
